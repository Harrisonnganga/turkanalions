    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Learning Lions is a digital empowerment program, providing opportunities
      to learn, earn and innovate for young adults in rural Kenya. We started
      off in 2015 in Turkana County, Northern Kenya, where traditional sources
      of income are extremely limited due to its semi-arid environment, poor
      infrastructure and remote location. We have built an ICT model campus at
      the shores of Lake Turkana in 2020. Our vision is to bring such digital
      centers of opportunities to many other marginalised communities. Our
      concept is: if we can make it here, we can make it anywhere.
    </p>
    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Building Strong Partnerships: Collaborate
      with industry leaders, educational institutions, and the community to
      enhance the learning experience and provide real-world insights.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Empowerment:</strong> Empowering Students: Provide opportunities
      for students to learn, earn and innovate through ICT and digital skills.
